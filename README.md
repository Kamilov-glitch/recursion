# recursion
Assingments by The Odin Project

Assigment 1:
1. Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.

2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).


Assignment 2:
1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
